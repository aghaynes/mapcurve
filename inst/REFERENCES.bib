  abstract = {We present Mapcurves, a quantitative goodness-of-fit (GOF) method
	that unambiguously shows the degree of spatial concordance between
	two or more categorical maps. Mapcurves graphically and quantitatively
	evaluate the degree of fit among any number of maps and quantify
	a GOF for each polygon, as well as the entire map. The Mapcurve method
	indicates a perfect fit even if all polygons in one map are comprised
	of unique sets of the polygons in another map, if the coincidence
	among map categories is absolute. It is not necessary to interpret
	(or even know) legend descriptors for the categories in the maps
	to be compared, since the degree of fit in the spatial overlay alone
	forms the basis for the comparison. This feature makes Mapcurves
	ideal for comparing maps derived from remotely sensed images. A translation
	table is provided for the categories in each map as an output. Since
	the comparison is category-based rather than cell-based, the GOF
	is resolution-independent. Mapcurves can be applied either to entire
	map categories or to individual raster patches or vector polygons.
	Mapcurves also have applications for quantifying the spatial uncertainty
	of particular map features.},
